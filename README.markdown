# Hayaku Bundle
Oh, hi, there is my humble bundle with some nice features like smart CSS abbreviations expand and some useful general-purpose commands.

Everything there right now is an early alpha status, there are a lot of bugs and flaws, but I hope I could find time to make it better and better. However, you can fork me, fix anything you want and request a pull!

## [Smart CSS Expand](wiki/Css-Expand/)
This bundle uses a [zen-coding](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/) like syntax to expand different CSS abbreviations into a full CSS properties with values.

It uses some dictionary with all the CSS properties and values in a hash and when you expand an abbreviation it tries find an appropriate pair and give you just what you want. The dictionary right now is hand-filled, but I plan to fill it automatically by some script from the actual w3 specs and other sources.

The bundle uses an `Tab` key for expand.

## Other features
Besides CSS Expand I've added some features that I dreamed for. Look for their description in wiki!
